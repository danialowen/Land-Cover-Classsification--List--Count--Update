# Land Cover Classsification List, Count, and Update
 This Python code is intended to print the land cover classes in a raster layer, count the number of pixels in each class, and also how to update pixel class values with another raster layer with a different extent.

The Python Notebook was created using Jupyter Labs and saved as a ipynb file: `"LandCoverClassification.ipynb"`.
